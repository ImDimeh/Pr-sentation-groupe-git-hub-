# I am the Markdown File
This is a resume of the presentation project wich was given to us🚧

On this github you'll be able to see a project conducted by second year students in Coding👩‍💻 and digital innovation major.

Firstly when entering you will land on our home page which presents our team as well as our team work reunited in the nav bar.
then when starting to clic on the names , you'll be redirected on each members pages that took their heart and time to present a colleague👨‍💼👩‍💼.
You will then get to discover some traits😣 😂 🤣 😃 😄 😅 😆  about us in every single page as well as some projects that we did in the past when starting our journeys in coding.


**Be careful 🚨🚨🚨🚨, we did our best to maintain the same structure for the navbar in the pages but added some changes in the style of the nav bar itself depending on the theme of the page you're in** 
**In the presentation for lynda for example ,you will have to click on the logo to go back to the main page🚨**

**The website is responsive so you can also check the site on your mobile phone ☎️**
** We are not promoting the school don't worry  <img src="https://dev.meilleurs-masters.com/logo_ecole/2020_iim.png" alt="" width="400">,
<br>This is an assignment.**
